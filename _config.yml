user_description: I am a student, always ready to learn and improve, taking on new challenges and traveling towards new horizons. Lately I have been immersing myself in the world of distributed quantum computing, working as an intern on quantum algorithms with Welinq, a Paris based startup that seeks to provide solutions for the interconnection of quantum processes.
